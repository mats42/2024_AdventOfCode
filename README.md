# Advent of Code 2024
My Clojure solutions to some of this years AoC puzzles: 
https://adventofcode.com/2024

# Getting started
Many alternatives exist, this is one.

## 1. Prepare
- Install Clojure, eg using ```brew install clojure``` if you are on macOS.
- Install VS Code if you don't already have that.
- Add VS Code plugin: `Calva`.

## 2. Get familiar with Clojure and the REPL
- Open VS Code and run the command `Calva: Create a Getting Started REPL project`.
- Calva will create a few files that you can explore and play around with to learn more about Clojure and what a REPL is.

## 3. The project
- Open this project folder in VS Code.
- Run command: `Calva: Start a project REPL and Connect (aka Jack-in)`.
- Open any of the `src/aoc2024/dayX.clj` files and test the solutions using the REPL.
- Input files are not included in this repo, add your own under `src/resources/` as eg `day1.txt`.
- Alternatively: Run all solutions using ```clj -M -m aoc2024.run-all```.
